A new responsive template featuring a flat (but not too flat) minimalistic design, spacious
layout, and styling for all basic page elements. Its demo images* are courtesy of the supremely
talented photographer Felicia Simion. If you like photography or just enjoy being blown away by
awesome stuff, check out her portfolio for more stunning images:
